#How to read a paper?#

Reasearchers must read papers for serveral reasons: to review them for a conference or a class, to keep current in their field, or for a literature survey of a new field.

##The three-pass approach##

- The first pass gives you a general idea about the paper.
- The second pass lets you grasp the paper's content, but not its details.
- The third pass helps you understand the paper in depth.

###The first pass###

This pass should take about **five to ten minutes** and consists of the following steps:

1. Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction.
2. Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else.ss
3. Read the conclusions.
4. Glance over the references, mentally ticking off the ones you've already read.

###The second pass###

In the second pass, read the paper with greater care, but ignore details such as proofs. It helps to jot down the key points, or to make comments in the margins, as you read.

1. Look carefully at the figures, diagrams and other illustrations in the paper. Pay special attention to graphs.
2. Remember to mark relevant unread references for further reading.

The second pass should take up to **an hour**. After this pass, you should be able to grasp the content of the paper.

###The third pass###

To fully understand a paper, particularly if you are reviewer, requires a third pass. The key to the third pass is to attempt to virtually re-implement the paper: that is, making the same assumptions as the authors, re-create the work.

This comparison of the actual with the virtual lends a sharp insight into the proof and presentation techniques in the paper and you can very likely add this to your repertoire of tools. During this pass, you should also jot down ideas for future work.

This pass can take about **four or five hours** for beginners, and about an hour for an experienced reader. In particular, you should be able to pinpoint implicit assumptions, missing citations to relevant work, and potential issues with experimental or analytical techniques.

##Doing a literature survey##

First, use an academic search engine such as Google Scholar or CiteSeer and some well-chosen keywords to find three to five recent papers in the area. Do one pass on each paper to get a sense of the work, then read their related work sections.

Second step, find shared citations and repeated author names in the bibliography. These are the key papers and researchers in that area. Download the key papers and set them aside. Then go to the websites of the key researchers and see where they've published recently.

The third step is to go to the website for these top conferences and look through their recent proceedings. These papers, along with the ones you set aside earlier, constitute the first version of your survey. Make two passes through these papers.

##Related work##

If you are reading a paper to do a review, you should also read Timothy Roscoe's paper on ["Writing reviews for systems conferences"][1]. If you're planning to write a technical paper, you should refer both to [Henning Schulzrinne's comprehensive web site][2] and [George Whitesides's excellent overview of the process][3].
