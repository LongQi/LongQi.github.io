原文：[点这里](http://violentmetaphors.com/2013/08/25/how-to-read-and-understand-a-scientific-paper-2/)

##Before you begin: some general advice

- 读文章的顺序有讲究，并非是按照文章呈现的章节顺序去读
- 要记笔记
- 要多读几遍
- 可能还要查阅其他文章来获取更多细节

文章的格式：

- Abstract
- Introduction
- Methods
- Results
- Conclusions/Interpretations/Discussion

在开始阅读之前，要记下来作者、研究机构、期刊名、会议名

##Step-by-step instructions for reading a primary research article

**1. Begin by reading the introduction, not the abstract.**

**2. Identify the BIG QUESTION.**

Not "What is this paper about?", but "What problem is this entire field trying to solve?".

**3. Summarize the background in five sentences or less.**

- What work has been done before in this field to answer the BIG QUESTION?
- What are the limitations of that work?

**4. Identify the SPECIFIC QUESTION**

-What exactly are the authors trying to answer with their research?
**5. Identify the approach**

- What are the authors going to do to answer the SPECIFIC QUESTION？

**6. Now read the methods sections. Draw a diagram for each experiment, showing exactly what the authors did.**

- you need to fully understand the work.
- you should explain the basic of the methods to someone else.

**7. Read the results section. Write one or more paragraphs to summarize the results for each experiment, each figure, and each table. Don't yet try to decide what the results mean, just write down what they are.**

**8. Do the results answer the SPECIFIC QUESTION？ What do you think they mean?**

**9. Read the conclusion/discussion/Interpretation section.**

- What do the authors think the results mean?
- Do you agree with them?
- Can you come up with any alternative way of interpreting them?
- Do the authors identify any weaknesses in their own study?
- Do you see any that the authors missed?
- What do they propose to do as a next step?
- Do you agree with that?

**10. Now, go back to the beginning and read the abstract.**

- Does it match what the authors said in the paper?
- Does it fit with your interpretation of the paper?

**11. FINAL STEP: What do other researchers say about this paper?**
